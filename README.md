## The brief

You receive a message from a prospective employer:

"Before your interview, write a program that runs a server that is accessible on `http://localhost:4000/`. When your server receives a request on `http://localhost:4000/set?somekey=somevalue` it should store the passed key and value in memory. When it receives a request on `http://localhost:4000/get?key=somekey` it should return the value stored at `somekey`.

If you finish, you can work on saving the data to a file."

Create a new git repository and write code to fulfil the brief to the best of your ability. Store the data in memory, not in a database, but bear in mind that you will later need to add a database to this code.

### To get it working locally

Run the command: 'git clone git@github.com:crsanghani/database-tech-test.git' in your terminal

Navigate to the directory and type 'bundle' in to your terminal

Now type ruby ./lib/my_app.rb and visit the http://localhost:4000 URL to navigate to the app page

### Solution
- [x] Create a new web server - using sinatra
- [x] Modify sinatra to output on ```localhost:4000``` instead of the usual ```localhost:4567```
- [x] Create a new /get path
- [x] On path take in given parameters and set them as a key and value
- [x] Output the values in a string
- [x] Create a new /set path
- [x] On path take in the session and output value from the key
- [x] Output the value in a string

### Future Advancements
- [ ] Have a data store to store each of the key:value pairs
